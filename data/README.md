This folder contains sprites and fonts used in Teora.

To build, run `make all`, but install the prerequisites listed below first.

## fonts

Teora sometimes uses a special font, `Teoran Standard`, which can be built with `python make.py`.

It requires the following packages (`pip install` them):

- [`fontforge`](https://fontforge.org): The Python extension is automatically installed alongside fontforge itself.
- `svgwrite`
- `Pillow`
