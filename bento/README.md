# bento

Bento is a high-level game engine based on [ebiten] that simplifies creating 2D games.

Bento is meant to be used together with ebiten; you can always fallback to ebiten for finer-grained control over graphics.

You may want to read the [API] documentation and general [reference] first.

## Disclaimer

Bento is experimental, and it is under developement. Its API is subject to breaking changes.
